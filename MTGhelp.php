        Hey there! at the top right you'll find a very useful navigation menu.
        <br>
        Home will take you to the main search bar and some other things that
        <br>
        have yet to be implemented.
        <br> <br>
        Registration open! Login Working! You can now search all white and some blue cards
        <br>
        From Alpha!
        <br>
        In time this page, as well as the others, will be filled with dynamic content!
        <br>
        Hope to see you then!
    </p>
